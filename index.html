        Thinking like a programmer

        <p>
           Thinking like a programmer involves the combination of <em>procedural thinking</em>, <em>abstract thinking</em>,and <em>systems thinking</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
              <em>Procedural thinking</em> involves creating perfectly clear and unambiguous instructions for a computer to follow.
        </p>
        <p>
              <em>Abstract thinking</em> means finding similarity, or as programmers would say,   generality  amongst seemingly different things.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Systems thinking</em> happens when you break a big problem down into smaller pieces. Programmers do this when they create a plan (often on paper) for how a program will work. It involves big-picture thinking and decision-making about a problem and how different pieces of a program can work together to solve it.

            The World Wide Web
        </div>
         <div class="concept-description">   
        <p>
          The web is made up of tons of computers that communicate with each other via <em>HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer protocol)</em>. 
          The major pieces of the web are you, and your computer, the internet itself, and servers serving .html pages.

         <div class="concept-description"> 
         <p>
          HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, it is made up of text and is the main type of document found on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML documents are made of tags and elements, HTML tags tell browsers the type of elements via HTML. You can find more on html tags and elements.<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/htmL/html_elements.asp">here</a>

           Inline elements are a displayed without line breaks.
         </p>
         <p> 
           Block elements form an invisible box around the content.

         Why start with HTML?
       </div>
       <div class="concept-description"> 
        <p>
           HTML is very visual. As I make changes in codepen I can see my work take form, helping me catch errors or things that did not work, as I expected them to.

       <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Every element of a web page can be broken up into a series of boxes, using div tags and css.

          A great analogy for HTML, and CSS
        </div> 
       <div class="concept-description"> 
        <p>
          HTML is like the structure of a house. Where are the walls going to be? What room is the bedroom?. How high is the roof?
        <p>
          CSS is like the styling of the house. What color are those walls? Do I want tile floors or  Carpet? What color will the tile/carpet be? 
        </p>
        <p>
          So to sum it up.. HTML is the structure, and CSS is the styling of the contents of the structure.

         All about CSS
       </div>
        <div class="concept-description">  
        <p>
          CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. We can use CSS to avoid repeating ourselves, using the same code to apply styles to like portions of our HTML. Avoiding repetition helps us write cleaner and more efficient code. Less lines of code uses less bandwidth   and is easier to troubleshoot.

          Inheritance
       </div>
        <div class="concept-description">   
        <p>
          Inheritance is the process by which properties are passed from parent to child elements even though those properties have not been explicitly defined by other means. Certain properties are inherited automatically, and as the name implies, a child element will take on the characteristics of its parent with regards to these properties.

        <div class="concept-description">
        <ol type="1">  
        <li>Look for natural boxes (everything on the web is a box)</li>
        <li>Look for repeated styles and semantic elements</li>
        <li>Write your html</li>
        <li>Apply Styles</li>
        <li>Fix things</li>

          Back to the house analogy
       </div> 
       <div class="concept-description">    
        <p>
          Build the house before you furnish it, and paint it. Build your html structure before you add contents and style, then come back with the paint/contents and style. This will make things flow better.
